# AI-Driven Smart Glove

## Overview
The AI-Driven Smart Glove is an innovative project designed to capture joint motion and tactile feedback using a 3D-printed piezoelectric sensor. The glove uses a combination of **triboelectric sensing**, **signal processing**, and advanced **hybrid LSTM-Transformer models** to accurately detect and classify finger movements. This project integrates Arduino for real-time data collection and AI for enhanced motion detection.

## Project Components

### 1. **3D-Printed PVDF Triboelectric Sensor**
   - A **Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF)**-based triboelectric sensor is designed to detect joint movement and provide tactile feedback.
   - The sensor is integrated into the glove for adaptive motion sensing, capturing real-time finger gestures.

### 2. **Arduino Program**
   - An **Arduino program** is used to interface with the piezoelectric sensor, allowing it to capture data from the sensor and send it to a processing unit for real-time motion detection.
   - The program reads the voltage generated by finger movements, which is then processed to detect specific gestures.

### 3. **Signal Processing**
   - **Signal processing techniques** are applied to clean and prepare the raw data collected from the sensor. This includes noise reduction and normalization to improve the accuracy of motion detection.

### 4. **Hybrid LSTM-Transformer Model**
   - The **Hybrid LSTM-Transformer model** is applied to the processed sensor data for accurate motion classification.
   - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** layers capture sequential dependencies in the motion data, while **Transformer** layers enhance performance by modeling long-range dependencies.
   - This hybrid approach significantly improves the gloveâ€™s ability to classify finger movements accurately.

## Features
- **Real-time Motion Detection**: Arduino processes sensor data for immediate response.
- **AI-Powered Gesture Classification**: Uses machine learning models to identify various hand gestures.
- **Customizable Design**: The 3D-printed sensor and glove can be modified for different user needs.
- **Tactile Feedback**: Provides feedback based on the detected movements, improving user interaction.
